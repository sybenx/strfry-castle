# DECISIONS.md — the graveyard and the waiting room

Decisions made during design, recorded so they are not relitigated by
accident. Claude Code: append here whenever you make a call CLAUDE.md
doesn't cover. Format: date, decision, one-line why.

## Rejected (do not build)

- **Guests tier / thread-context promotion / protected_events.json** —
  required storing event ids (violates the state invariant) and duplicated
  the Lord's Chronicle relay. Thread context is Chronicle's job.
- **FETCH_CONTEXT / PARDON_BACKFILL flags** — flags on core behavior are two
  code paths; behaviors were chosen instead (no fetching, no backfill).
- **kind-5 report voids + kind-30000 pardon-list sync** — undo now lives in
  exactly one place: the web UI pardon, through the ledger.
- **Favorite reparenting (cut-branch favorites become the Lord's invitees)** —
  obsolete once elevation became tree-independent. Nothing to rescue.
- **Automatic backfill of all follows/citizens** — a standing network job
  with real bandwidth, disk, and relay-reputation costs. Archival is manual,
  per-member, one-shot (the scribe).
- **Towncrier as a feed (rendering members' notes)** — turns the page into a
  Nostr client; kills the 60KB budget. Rows link to njump instead.
- **Automated diamond-sorting (public reports, follows-of-follows
  whitelists, AI filtering)** — public reports are gameable (NIP-56),
  whitelists kill the open lands, and the raid already IS the moderation:
  spam is outlived, not judged.
- **install.sh editing strfry.conf / compose / proxy configs** — auto-editing
  unknown Umbrel/Portainer stacks bricks relays. Print, never edit.

## Deferred (real ideas, wrong day)

- **NIP-86 admin shim** (banpubkey/allowpubkey/... routed by Content-Type,
  OWNER_PUBKEY only, through the ledger). Demand should precede code;
  the API + towncrier cover every operation.
- **One-click self-update** (Lord-only /api/update → helper container runs
  compose pull && up -d; steward image bundles gatekeeper and refreshes
  /plugin/ on boot). Most delicate code in the project — ship the update
  banner first, add this as its own late phase with a disabled-by-default
  first release.
- **Ward viewer permissions** (a ward_viewers pubkey list checked on
  GET /api/wards). Trivial whenever a concrete need appears — NIP-98 already
  authenticates every request. Until then, every viewer is a leak surface.
- **Random citizen note pulls** ("the castle feels alive": one REQ per cycle
  for a random citizen's recent notes). ~30 lines, harmless traffic, but not
  load-bearing. Considered, deferred.
- **Medieval office naming for steward modules** (constable/seneschal/
  bailiff/reeve, from a sibling design fork). Pure theming — the one real
  safety property under it (delete confinement) was adopted on its own.
  Rename modules later if the flavor is wanted; zero behavior change.
- **docker-socket-proxy hardening** (tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy limited
  to exec on the strfry container, replacing the raw socket mount).
  Documented in the README as the hardening option; make it the default if
  the project grows an audience.

## Decided (calls CLAUDE.md didn't make)

- **Ephemeral kinds (20000–29999) are rate-limited like any stranger
  traffic** — an exemption is a second code path, and the token bucket
  exists for write-path abuse, which ephemeral floods are. Citizens are
  already exempt. "Pass through per NIP-16" means strfry doesn't store
  them; it says nothing about the write path. Mirrored into CLAUDE.md's
  tier notes (the spec is the source of truth; behaviors must not live
  only here). Premise — that strfry routes ephemeral kinds through the
  write policy at all — is verified empirically in the Phase 1 smoke.
- **bytecheck is strict from day one; phasing lives in CI wiring, not
  Makefile logic** — a "not yet built, exit 0" soft mode is a conditional
  that outlives its purpose: after Phase 6a a missing index.html would
  pass green. One behavior (missing file = fail, >60KB = fail), added to
  the CI workflow in Phase 6a.
- **internal/stateformat is born in Phase 1, not retrofitted in 3a** —
  stdlib-only shared types for banned.json/citizens.json; refactoring a
  tagged v0.1.0 component mid-project costs more than starting shared.
- **Report intake is idempotent per report (ledger source-id dedupe)** —
  removing kind-5 voids created the zombie-ban bug: reports are immortal on
  relays, so re-reading the same 1984 every cycle re-banned pardoned
  pubkeys within CYCLE_MINUTES. Each report now bans exactly once, ever;
  domain re-enumeration and the kind-0 sweep skip pardoned pubkeys. Emergent
  semantics, intended: pardon beats everything before it, a NEW report is a
  fresh judgment and re-bans. Caught by a cross-fork review.
- **`strfry delete` is confined to one wrapper, two call sites** (raid.go +
  purge-newly-banned). The only irreversible operation gets one choke point
  where dry-run, batching, and audit logging live. Adopted from the other
  fork's chain-of-command design, minus the office theming.
- **Courtyard-neglect nudge uses event count and oldest age, never DB file
  size** — LMDB never shrinks (deleted pages are reused, the file stays at
  high-water mark), so `du` on the DB is monotonic and would nudge forever
  after a thorough raid. File size is an informational footnote at most.
- **Every ledger line carries `"v":1`** — ledger.jsonl is the durable
  source of truth; one version field turns a future format change into a
  migration instead of a replay break. Replay fails loudly on unknown
  versions.

## Accepted trade-offs (known, intentional)

- **docker.sock mount is root-equivalent** on the host from an
  internet-facing container. Accepted for one-DB-owner simplicity; disclosed
  in README; proxy is the mitigation path.
- **Ward privacy is obscurity, not cryptography.** Whim-timed raids give no
  clean TTL to fingerprint retention against. The threat model that defeats
  this ("someone obsessively measuring one stranger's event lifetimes")
  has better attacks available.
- **Scribe pagination is leaky** (shared timestamps, silent relay caps).
  Best-effort archival by design; no reconciliation engine.
- **Web-first pardons mean unbanning requires a browser with NIP-07** (on
  mobile: an Amber-style signer). Accepted for deleting two sync
  subsystems. Banning still works from any client via kind-1984 reports.
- **Domain bans re-enumerate at raid cadence, not cycle cadence.** A spam
  farm's fresh pubkeys live until the next raid. Acceptable: their events
  die in the same raid that bans them.
- **NIP-46 signer traffic through the castle gets rate-limited** — remote
  signing uses ephemeral non-citizen client keys, so it rides the stranger
  bucket (30/min, burst 60). Almost certainly invisible at human signing
  rates; if the Lord ever hits it, the fix is elevating the client key or
  raising the bucket, not an exemption code path.
- **Archiving a ward emits a metadata signal** — the scribe sends
  `{"authors":[ward]}` REQs to public relays, announcing the castle's
  interest in that pubkey to third parties. Same obscurity budget as ward
  privacy generally (declared obscurity-not-cryptography); accepted, but
  the Lord should know the scribe is the one place the castle actively
  asks about a ward in public.
- **The invariant permits provenance event ids** — ban sources and the
  follows-snapshot source are stored event ids, deliberately. The forbidden
  thing is event ids as retention/protection TARGETS. Earlier absolute
  wording ("never event ids") read as self-contradicting; reworded in
  CLAUDE.md and PLAN.md.
