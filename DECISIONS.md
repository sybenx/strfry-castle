# DECISIONS.md — the graveyard and the waiting room

Decisions made during design and the mid-build re-scope, recorded so they
are not relitigated by accident. Claude Code: append here whenever you make
a call CLAUDE.md doesn't cover. Format: decision, one-line why.

## The re-scope (after Phase 3a)

The Lord narrowed the project to three functions: the invite tree,
protected retention (follows + tree + elevated), and secret favorites
(wards). Everything below in this section was cut in one pass. Each entry
notes its revert path; none should be rebuilt without an explicit new call.

- **gatekeeper / any write-policy plugin** — with bans, mail, and rate
  limits all cut, the plugin's job list was empty; a component that only
  says "accept" is pure maintenance surface. Retention was always enforced
  at raid time, steward-side. Bonus: strfry's single writePolicy slot stays
  FREE, so any stock spam-filter plugin drops in with zero castle code —
  which retires the plugin-chaining requirement outright (chaining was
  only ever needed because the castle occupied the slot). Revert path: the
  built v0.1.1 gatekeeper lives in git history.
- **Bans, kind-1984 report intake, pardons, and domain bans** — never in
  the stated scope; the raid is the moderation, and write-path abuse
  filtering is a spam plugin's job in the free slot. Cutting them also
  deletes their hardest-won machinery (the zombie-ban source-id dedupe,
  raid-time domain re-enumeration, the kind-0 nip05 sweep,
  pardon-beats-ban ordering) — all real bugs that no longer have a place
  to live. Revert path: git history at Phase 3a; if bans return, the
  dedupe lesson below MUST return with them.
- **Castle Mail (the gift-wrap recipient rule + mail bucket + Vault)** —
  out of scope. Consequence, accepted with eyes open: NIP-59 gift wraps
  are signed by random one-time keys, so ALL DMs — including the Lord's
  own — age out at the raid like stranger events. Private DM storage is a
  dedicated relay's job (HAVEN). Stated on the landing page so nobody is
  surprised.
- **Rate limiting (both token buckets)** — existed only as spam knobs;
  spam filtering is delegated to the free writePolicy slot. steward's own
  HTTP API keeps its per-IP limit (different thing, trivial).
- **React-warding** (liking a note silently wards its author) — clever,
  unasked-for, and it carried the only PUBLIC_RELAYS note-fetching in the
  cycle. Wards are added through the UI like everything else.
- **The scribe / POST /api/archive** (paginated backfill of a member's
  history from public relays) — "follows don't get deleted" means don't
  delete what's here, not fetch what isn't. Archival-of-everything is the
  Chronicle relay's job.
- **Byte accounting, size estimates, the neglect nudge, and the
  close-the-gates budget backstop (OUTER_BUDGET_MB / gates.json)** — all
  machinery for a problem the Lord doesn't have: notes are tiny, he checks
  DB size by hand more often than it matters. The raid preview reports an
  event count; the human decides. If DB pressure ever becomes real,
  revisit — the cut designs are in the repo history under the
  SPEC-CHANGE files' final commit.
- **NIP-05 serving** — flavor, not function.

## Rejected earlier (still binding)

- **Building our own relay instead of attaching to strfry** — the castle's
  value is policy, not storage. strfry does the hard part better than a
  rewrite ever would, and the sidecar shape is what lets any existing
  strfry operator adopt the castle without migrating data.
- **Guests tier / thread-context promotion / protected_events.json** —
  required storing event ids as protection targets (violates the state
  invariant). Thread context is Chronicle's job.
- **Feature flags on core behavior (FETCH_CONTEXT, PARDON_BACKFILL, soft
  bytecheck, sync/paginate hybrids)** — two code paths for one behavior;
  choose a behavior instead.
- **Favorite reparenting** — obsolete once elevation became
  tree-independent. Nothing to rescue.
- **Towncrier as a feed (rendering members' notes)** — turns the page into
  a Nostr client; kills the 60KB budget. Rows link to njump instead.
- **install.sh editing strfry.conf / compose / proxy configs** —
  auto-editing unknown Umbrel/Portainer stacks bricks relays. Print, never
  edit.
- **steward holding the Lord's secret key, for any feature** — the
  container is internet-facing and root-equivalent via docker.sock; no
  feature justifies it.
- **Data-triggered automatic raids** — anyone who can inflate the DB would
  control the retention clock for everyone's outer-lands data. Deletion
  only ever happens by human decision.

## Deferred (real ideas, wrong day)

- **One-click self-update** (Lord-only /api/update → helper container runs
  compose pull && up -d). Most delicate code in the project — ship the
  update banner first; add this as its own late phase, disabled by default
  in its first release.
- **Ward viewer permissions** (a ward_viewers pubkey list on
  GET /api/wards). Trivial whenever a concrete need appears — NIP-98
  already authenticates every request. Until then, every viewer is a leak
  surface.
- **docker-socket-proxy hardening** (tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy limited
  to exec on the strfry container, replacing the raw socket mount).
  Documented in the README as the hardening option; make it the default if
  the project grows an audience.
- **Bans / write-path policy, if ever wanted again** — return as a
  separate phase resurrecting gatekeeper from git history, and re-read the
  re-scope section first: report intake without per-report ledger
  source-id dedupe re-bans pardoned pubkeys forever (reports are immortal
  on relays — the zombie-ban bug).

## Decided (calls CLAUDE.md didn't make, still live)

- **The door is outsourced; the government isn't** — the standing rule for
  "could a plugin/external tool do this?" questions. Per-event judgment on
  strangers belongs to third-party plugins in strfry's free writePolicy
  slot; anything touching state, retention, standing, or the tree lives in
  castle. External binaries only through the interfaced-wrapper pattern,
  and only when their availability on real deployments is verified —
  a capability upstream ships but operators commonly disable (e.g.
  negentropy sync) does not count as available.
- **bytecheck is strict from day one; phasing lives in CI wiring, not
  Makefile logic** — a "not yet built, exit 0" soft mode is a conditional
  that outlives its purpose. One behavior: missing file = fail, >60KB =
  fail. Wired into CI in Phase 6a.
- **Every ledger line carries `"v":1`** — ledger.jsonl is the durable
  source of truth; one version field turns a future format change into a
  migration instead of a replay break. Replay fails loudly on unknown
  versions AND, post-demolition, on the removed verbs (dev ledgers with
  old verbs are deleted, not migrated).
- **"Wild West" is renamed "the Outer Lands"** — one concept, one name
  (env var OUTER_TTL_DAYS), folded in before code existed.
- **/api/elevate SETS the requested visibility; only changes are ledgered
  as flip-visibility** — blind toggling meant the Lord re-favoriting
  someone could silently demote a public star into a ward.
- **Kind-0 name cache covers tree members ∪ public favorites ∪
  evicted-in-grace; /api/tree grows a `favored` array** — the public page
  needs names for the Favored and Evicted sections. Still never wards.
- **Manual raids take a per-raid TTL override; eviction grace never
  follows it** — the raid button gets a "days to protect" input (default
  OUTER_TTL_DAYS, min 1; cron raids always use the default; ledger records
  the value used). OUTER_TTL_DAYS protects two unrelated groups — old
  stranger events and recently-evicted members — and the override is aimed
  only at the first: dropping it to purge a spam wave must not wipe
  someone evicted yesterday, so grace stays pinned to the standing
  default.
- **Dry-run IS the raid preview** — {dry_run: true} runs the full scan,
  deletes nothing, returns the event count. Click-triggered, never
  slider-triggered. A per-day age histogram for instant estimates was
  considered and dropped; build it only if preview latency ever annoys.
- **`strfry delete` is confined to one wrapper, ONE call site** (raid.go —
  was two before bans were cut). The only irreversible operation gets one
  choke point where dry-run, batching, and audit logging live.
- **Raid results are "events purged," never disk shrink** — LMDB never
  shrinks (deleted pages are reused; the file stays at high-water mark),
  so `du` on the DB is monotonic. File size is an informational footnote,
  never a signal.
- **Re-elevating to the same visibility appends nothing to the ledger**
  (`State.Elevate` returns `ErrNoChange`; the API treats it as 200). The
  ledger records actual events, not API calls that touched nothing.

## Accepted trade-offs (known, intentional)

- **docker.sock mount is root-equivalent** on the host from an
  internet-facing container. Accepted for one-DB-owner simplicity;
  disclosed in README; the socket proxy is the mitigation path.
- **DMs are ephemeral on this relay** — see the Castle Mail cut above.
  The castle cannot even see whose DMs they are; that is the protocol
  working as designed.
- **Ward privacy is obscurity, not cryptography.** Whim-timed raids give
  no clean TTL to fingerprint retention against. The threat model that
  defeats this has better attacks available.
- **All admin actions require a browser with NIP-07** (on mobile: an
  Amber-style signer). One auth path, no sessions, no CLI admin surface.
- **Public towncrier data is published by choice** — tree lineage, the
  evicted list, grace expiries. A statement of intent, not a privacy
  proof; wards excepted absolutely.
